# Contributing to covid19india.org website

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Regarding Pull Requests to this project, always submit a PR against an "Accepted Issue" assigned to you. If an issue doesn't exist, please raise one first and wait for it to get accepted, and assigned. PRs without having accepted issues mentioned will be closed. The only exception to this rule are for PRs that address critical bug fixes that cannot wait for a maintainer's approval.

Two kinds of issues can be raised in this project:

1. Bug report
2. Feature Request

## Process Flow

- When a new issue is created, "Status: Review Needed" and "Type:Bug or Type:Enhancement" label is automatically added to it.
- Mods periodically check "Status:Review Needed" and add appropriate Priority and Status labels. If the issue is clear, set the status label as "Label: Available"
- People looking to contribute, filter issues by ["Status:Available"](https://github.com/covid19india/covid19india-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Available%22) and comment on the issue that they would like to be assigned to work on it.
- Mods change the status label to "Status:Accepted" and assign the issue to the contributor.
- Contributor change the label to "Status: In Progress" and finally submit the pull request.
